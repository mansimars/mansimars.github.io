## FAQs
---------
Why is Markdown better than a word
processor?
> Markdown is better than a word as it gives more freedom to the user to convert it to another files such as pdf, docx, html and then can be used anywhere depending on the specifications. In addition to that, we do not need to keep other formatted files as we can convert it anytime we need it. 

Can I use any other static site generator? Can you recommend some? 
> Yes, you can use other static site generators. Hugo, Gridsome, Eleventy, Pelican are also good static site generator that can help you to host a profile.
